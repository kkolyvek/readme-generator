## Installation

This application uses [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) - both are required.

## Usage

This readme generator is a simple command line program. Once installed and ran, the user will be prompted for several details:

- Full Name
- Project Title
- GitHub Username
- Email Address
- Whether to Include a 'Credit Given' Section
- Four Options for Open Source Software Licenses

Upon completion of the prompts, a `readme.md` file will be created in the working directory with a basic skeletal structure. The user must then fil each section out with actual content.
